# Perception implementation and acceptance map

This map is part of the approved [delivery plan](perception-expansion-plan.md). The [epic](https://github.com/NomaDamas/Gamst/issues/2) remains open until required implementation and validation pass. All entries below are required capability families. Named alternative models retain individual compatibility/execution status in the provider inventory; an alternative need not run concurrently with the selected provider.

## Evidence rules

The [2026-11-15 user direction](perception-expansion-plan.md#user-directed-software-continuation-2026-11-15)
allows the current software phase to finish before the actual experiments and
model/sensor checks below. These remain full product acceptance gates, not passed
checks. The [candidate execution matrix](candidate-execution-matrix.md) records
each selected implementation and unsupported alternative separately.

Each family requires an executable adapter, documented input/output contracts, repeatable validation command, actual inference or device-input evidence, and bounded streaming/lifecycle tests. Mock-backed contract tests do not prove model execution. Recorded sensor packets prove parsing, not live sensor operation. Missing hardware or checkpoints require child issues with acquisition/runtime requirements and reproduction steps; those issues block the family and overall completion. No capability silently becomes optional because it is difficult.

Minimum evidence records identify commit, model/checkpoint hash, dependency versions, device, input fixture provenance, command, output, timing, limitations and reviewer. Actual hardware acquisition is not assumed authorized as a purchase; unavailable equipment remains an explicit blocker while software work continues.

## Required capability coverage

1. Detection and tracking — [P03 #5](https://github.com/NomaDamas/Gamst/issues/5). Minimum: RF-DETR Nano or YOLO detector plus stateful tracking; boxes, class scores and track IDs. Frame/native modes. Validate real clip inference with crossing tracks, disappearance and reset. Depends on P01/P02.
2. Open-vocabulary detection — P03. Minimum: YOLOE text/exemplar path; prompted boxes/masks. Frame mode. Validate unseen prompt categories and empty results on labeled inputs.
3. Segmentation and mask tracking — P03. Minimum: current image SAM path plus a SAM3.1 or EfficientTAM video path; masks and track continuity. Declare lookahead/state. Validate occlusion, gap reset and real model execution.
4. Body, hands, face and gaze — P03. Minimum: MediaPipe body/face/hands plus L2CS gaze or documented equivalent; landmarks, gesture and direction estimates. Frame mode with explicit smoothing state. Validate multiple people/hands, no face, confidence and camera coordinates.
5. OCR and visual retrieval — P03. Minimum: PP-OCR mobile and embedding provider; text/boxes and similarity candidates. Frame mode. Validate languages, repeated labels, rotated text and non-identical similar objects.
6. Depth, flow and mapping — P03. Minimum: Depth Anything Small, OpenCV flow and ORB-SLAM3 bridge; relative depth, image displacement and tracked camera frame. Frame/native modes. Validate motion, scale/coordinate metadata, tracking loss; metric output requires calibrated sensor evidence.
7. Voice activity and ASR — [P04 #6](https://github.com/NomaDamas/Gamst/issues/6). Minimum: VAD plus Nemotron or Qwen streaming ASR; activity and partial/final/revision text. Native mode. Validate Korean/English audio, silence, overlapping chunks, revisions and discontinuities. Depends on P01/P02.
8. Environment sound — P04. Minimum: YAMNet; windowed event scores. Validate labeled non-speech recordings and window latency; preserve ambient input alongside speech cleanup.
9. Prosody and vocal-expression candidates — P04. Minimum: energy, pitch, speaking rate plus emotion2vec-compatible classification; units and inference status. Window/native DSP modes. Validate tones, silence, clipping and real speech; no emotional ground-truth claim from model scores.
10. Diarization and active speaker — P04. Minimum: Streaming Sortformer (selected Nemotron-3 successor adapter, actual acceptance #116) and TalkNet bridge; speaker segments and audiovisual association. Native/window modes with lookahead. Validate two speakers, off-screen speech, clock skew and face absence.
11. Array direction and source selection — P04. Minimum: GCC-PHAT/SRP direction and beamforming bridge; angle and selected audio source. Window/native mode. Validate known array geometry and measured direction; one-channel input cannot claim direction.
12. Duplex signal processing — P04/P02. Minimum: playback-reference WebRTC AEC integration and separate ambient lane. Native mode. Validate simultaneous playback/input, residual echo, missing reference and uninterrupted sensing.
13. Cross-modal source separation — P04. Minimum: SAM-Audio executable optional backend; selected source with prompt provenance. Declare actual window/offline constraints. Validate prompted source extraction; do not label untested causal behavior realtime.
14. Thermal — [P05 #7](https://github.com/NomaDamas/Gamst/issues/7). Minimum: radiometric frame adapter; ROI Celsius statistics and calibration metadata. Frame/sensor cadence. Validate sensor packet and live known-target measurement; RGB estimates never become measured temperature.
15. CSI and radar — P05. Minimum: ESP-CSI motion pipeline and TI radar tracks; CSI features, range/velocity/angle. Native/window modes. Validate real packet ingestion, clutter, reconnect and live controlled motion; hardware setup recorded.
16. Through-wall pose/action — P05. Minimum: executable RF-Pose/RF-Action-compatible research path with required radio input. Declare trained setup and windowing. Validate controlled occluded scenarios with actual radio hardware; ordinary RSSI is insufficient.
17. IMU and touch — P05. Minimum: calibrated IMU adapter and DIGIT/GelSight plus Sparsh-compatible task head; acceleration/angular velocity/contact or slip candidates. Native/frame modes. Validate units, orientation, saturation and actual sensor/task evidence.
18. Gas/environment — P05. Minimum: BME688/690 measurements and trained pattern classifier bridge. Sensor/window modes. Validate sensor timing, environmental channels and labeled gas-pattern data; no universal smell claim.
19. Event camera, rPPG and visual vibration — P05. Minimum: OpenEB events, EfficientPhys-compatible rPPG and visual-microphone processing paths. Native/window/offline modes respectively unless stronger evidence exists. Validate real event stream, pulse reference and synchronized high-speed vibration evidence. Separate hardware child issues are mandatory if unavailable.
20. Food — [P06 #8](https://github.com/NomaDamas/Gamst/issues/8). Minimum: food detector/segmenter with target-cuisine checkpoint; labels/masks. Frame mode. Validate held-out foods and unknowns; mass/calories require additional measurements. Depends on P03.
21. Liquid — P06. Minimum: calibrated container fill pipeline and OpenPIV bridge; fill fraction/volume and calibrated flow. Frame/window mode. Validate known fill levels, container geometry, transparent-liquid failures and a calibrated PIV sample.
22. Physical relations — P06. Minimum: timestamped track/depth geometry plus physical-concept inference path; velocity, approach, support/contact candidates. Native/window mode. Validate known trajectories and frame transformations; distinguish measured force from visual hypotheses.
23. Observation memory — [P07 #9](https://github.com/NomaDamas/Gamst/issues/9). Minimum: bounded entity history/query with provenance; last-seen/visibility/relations. Validate disappearance beyond latest-signal retention, reappearance ambiguity, moving camera, expiry and clear. Depends on P01/P03.
24. Semantic VLM and efficiency — [P08 #10](https://github.com/NomaDamas/Gamst/issues/10). Minimum: existing Qwen path plus small video-capable provider and streaming-state backend where supported; semantic observations with window provenance. Validate actual model inference and matched cost/latency/quality gates in the delivery plan. Depends on P02/P03/P04.

## Cross-cutting implementation and end-to-end gates

- [P01 #3](https://github.com/NomaDamas/Gamst/issues/3): registry and sensor/output contracts. Reject malformed, nonfinite and oversized payloads; custom modality roundtrip; no implicit model execution; existing API compatibility.
- [P02 #4](https://github.com/NomaDamas/Gamst/issues/4): concurrent independent sensors with bounded queues. Replay audio/video plus another sensor while playback continues and one provider stalls. Prove other lanes progress, affected state resets on gaps and no stale outputs survive clear.
- [P09 #11](https://github.com/NomaDamas/Gamst/issues/11): same capability schemas across Python, live API and MCP; discover/configure/latest/history/memory/status. Test slow consumer, reconnect, user cadence under overload, freshness and revision display. Capture cadence and delivery cadence remain distinct.
- [P10 #12](https://github.com/NomaDamas/Gamst/issues/12), detailed [#1](https://github.com/NomaDamas/Gamst/issues/1): optional profiling without automatic endpoint/sensor activation; bounded enabled probes; requested/recommended/applied cadence. Test unavailable host features, timeout and cache invalidation. ACK does not imply comprehension.
- [P11 #13](https://github.com/NomaDamas/Gamst/issues/13): optional dependency and license profiles plus per-model execution matrix; core import offline; incompatible runtime isolation; actionable install failures.
- [P12 #14](https://github.com/NomaDamas/Gamst/issues/14): all preceding gates, exact-head independent GPT-6.1 Sol High reviews, CI, approved-plan audit and merges. Documentation PRs are reviewed too. No overall completion with required open subissues.

Before each implementation merge, link the affected entries, test commands/results and remaining validation issues in the PR. Before release, rerun real-model/device scenarios and matched efficiency evaluation; preserve all scope not yet proven. Each unavailable hardware/research path must have a separately linked subissue before its package can be considered for completion.

Food software integration: [SegFormer-B0 context](food-context.md); trained checkpoint and held-out target-cuisine/unknown-food acceptance remain open in [#148](https://github.com/NomaDamas/Gamst/issues/148). Generated untrained graph tests do not satisfy family 20.

2026-11-14 scope audit: [remaining sensory paths and issue-state reconciliation](remaining-sensory-gates.md)
links dedicated required mapping #186, SAM-Audio #187, tactile #188 and radio
pose/action #189 subissues. These are additions to the tracking hierarchy, not
newly optional families or claims of implementation support. Physical-concept
acceptance remains under #105; all other existing family gates still apply.
