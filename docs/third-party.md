# Third-party source and model policy

For the approved expansion, use the current
[candidate execution/runtime/license matrix](candidate-execution-matrix.md).
The installation history below does not establish which assets are currently
present or validate an alternative model. Actual experiments and model/sensor
validation are deferred by the user's 2026-11-15 direction.

This checkout contains original integration code. Model weights are downloaded
separately into the ignored project-owned `.local-models` directory and are not
included in GitHub source or Python wheels. Optional dependencies retain their
own licenses. A code license and a model-weight license are separate obligations.

Earlier development downloaded official model artifacts, consulted upstream
documentation and pushed repository changes. That history does not establish
current network access or locally installed assets. No inspected or reused REA
implementation is claimed here.

## Historical integrations and artifact provenance

- **OpenCV:** built-in HOG person detector, normalized boxes and local IoU tracking.
- **MediaPipe Tasks:** explicit face-landmarker task file, landmarks and blendshapes.
  Body pose is also implemented with explicit local task weights and a real
  33-landmark fixture check; gesture interpretation and identity remain separate.
- **Silero VAD / PyTorch:** local JIT voice-activity model.
- **faster-whisper / CTranslate2:** local Whisper small weights, windowed ASR.
- **Qwen3-VL / llama.cpp:** local GGUF vision-language model and projection weights,
  served by an explicitly downloaded local runner.
- **SUPERB / Transformers:** optional `superb/wav2vec2-base-superb-er` weights for
  four voice-emotion scores, installed by `scripts/setup_voice.sh`.
- **sounddevice / PortAudio:** optional native microphone I/O.
- **websockets / httpx:** optional local streaming transports and provider clients.

`scripts/local_models.py` records download URLs and SHA-256 hashes in
`.local-models/manifest.json`; model revisions are pinned where supported. Review
upstream asset licenses, notices and permitted redistribution terms for the exact
artifacts. The installer downloads into the user's checkout; it does not grant a
new license to redistribute those weights. The public browser preview separately
loads MediaPipe code and its face-model asset from the documented external URLs.

## Extension boundaries

SAM3, YOLO, Pipecat and LiveKit implementations are not vendored. The
[SAM3 sampled-image adapter](sam3.md) and [YOLOE native adapter](yoloe-context.md)
now exist; neither establishes support for SAM3.1 video tracking, YOLO26n or every
YOLO checkpoint. Actual selected-model/device acceptance remains separately
tracked in the matrix. The existing plugin interface is an integration boundary,
not proof that every external model is plug-and-play. The LiveKit/Pipecat
decoded-media bridges likewise do not establish compatibility with every
framework release.

Hugging Face and Ollama interfaces and Pipecat pipeline concepts are credited in
[streaming architecture](streaming-and-plugins.md). These are protocol and design
references, not claims of copied code or endorsement. Remote provider connectors
require explicit configuration and credentials; use of a paid provider is not
included in a local installation. Never include credentials in logs, examples or
release assets.
